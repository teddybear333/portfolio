          Context
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          Redesign was a project for CSCI 1300: User Interfaces and User
          Experiences, a course at Brown University taught by
          <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Huang</a>.
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
            The goal was to document the workflow in redesigning an existing webpage by integrating UI principles of learnability, usability, and memorability. 
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
            The webpage chosen for the redesign is the landing page of <a href="https://www.torontocupcake.com/index.html" target="_blank">Toronto Cupcake</a>, an online cupcake ordering and delivering service. This page was selected due to its potential for improvement in navigation and layout. 
            This project aimed to enhance the user experience when interacting with the page. This was achieved by analyzing the original website, prototyping low-fidelity and high-fidelity mockups of the landing page, and coding a responsive design with HTML and CSS.

        <div class="subtitle">
          Accessibility
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
            Accessibility enables individuals with diverse abilities to effectively use an interface. As part of the analysis process, I first put the orignal webpage into <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://www.torontocupcake.com/index.html" target="_blank">WebAIM WAAVE</a>, a tool to help detect possible accessibility problems <br><br>
            The tool notes the following issues for the webpage: <br>
               - Multiple links go to the same URL <br>
               - Some link-texts contain information that are out of context <br>
               - Menu bar cannot be easily accessed <br>
               - Alternative text is present for an image that is within a link <br><br>
            These are all points that need attention during the early stages of the redesign process. 
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
            Wireframing
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            Below is an image of the original landing page. The interface lacks a central hub to navigate through the site and is instead locked away through a small menu bar that can be easily missed. The content displayed throughout the page lacks structure and is disorganized. 
          </div>
          <br>
          <img class="body-image" src="images/responsive redesign/ipad.jpg" alt="lowfi">
          <div class="body-text">
            I created three wireframes (desktop, tablet, and mobile view) to help simplify the landing page while keeping the site's main purpose and functionality. 
  
            The major changes include simplifying the overall features, making the navigation and footer selections more distinct, reforming the hierarchical strucutre, and organizing the overall layout of the interface. These changes decluttered distracting
            content and unnecessary information, optimizing the user flow of the page.

              The finalized redesign focuses significantly on eliminating ambiguous aspects of the original site. A more accessible navigation bar and footer were worked into the new interface. The structure of the original webpage was reconstructed so that clear strucutres and categories were presented, allowing the flow of the page to come to life.
