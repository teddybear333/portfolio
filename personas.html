          Context
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          In this project for CSCI 1300: User Interfaces and User Experiences,
          a Brown University course taught by
          <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Huang</a>, 
          we were tasked to choose one interface we have interacted with and analyze it using concepts of personas and storyboarding. 
          <br /><br />
          I chose to analyze the self checkout station at my local supermarket. 
          Self checkout stations at grocery stores may seem like a good alternative to checkout customers while employees focus on non-automated tasks but these systems can be challenging to use if they are not user-friendly or if customers are not used to technology. Below is the process and persona construction of the self checkout station. 
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
          Description
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          This interface lets customers scan their items, bag their items as they scan them, and pay for their purchases, all without the assistance from employees. 
        </div>
        <img
          class="body-image persona"

          alt="sketch"
        />
        <div class="body-text">
          This is executed using the combination of a touchscreen, scanner, baggging area, PIN pad, and a receipt dispenser. 
        </div>

          Behavioral Observation
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          While observing customers, the line for the self
          checkout was much longer than that for the cashier. After one customer
          finished bagging and walked away, the next person in line would walk
          up to the station. For the most part, users were able to go through
          the checkout process efficiently. Customers’ interactions
          with using the self checkout station were observed and collected. Below is a list of customer behavior and attitudes while using self
          checkout.
          <ul>
            <li>
              One customer had to swift barcode over scanner a few times for scanner to register their item, moved their item from the bag to another in the bagging area midway through the scanning process which caused system to display error message, and had to request help from an employee to override the error message.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many customers clicked on the touchscreen buttons without having to read any labels, only purchased a few small items and clicked the “Skip Bagging” option, and used tap to pay with phone to complete the PIN pad transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Several customers had difficulty weighing items, noticed that the system did not update the price for a discounted product, or entered in a wrong item and had to ask for employee assistence to revert actions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">User Interviews</div>
        <div class="body-text bold">
          Do you prefer self checkout or going to the cashier and what are some reasons you prefer one over the other??
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <ul>
            User 1: <i>Prefer self checkout because the lines are usually shorter.</i>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 2: <i>Self checkout is pretty fast and great when buying a small number of items on the go or in a hurry.</i>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 3: <i>I use self checkout more often because ittle socializing is needed and the interface gives a sense of control in the order of how items are scanned and bagged.</i>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="body-text bold">
          What do you think can be improved with the interface of the self
          checkout station?

        <div class="body-text">
          <ul>
            User 1: <i>
              It could allow me more time to scan and bag a product before moving on to the next tiem. 
            </i>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 2: <i>Nothing. It's pretty easy to use as it is.</i>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 3: <i>The scanner and bagging area should work in conjuction with the buttons.</i>
          </ul>

        <div class="body-text bold">
          Are there any parts of the interface that you find confusing or challenging?

            User 1: <i>There's too many buttons on the interface. It takes me awhile to find what I want to click at times.</i>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 2: <i>Not really. I don't have to think too much when using it.</i>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 3: <i>It's just so error prone which makes the process a lot slower.</i>
          </ul>

        <div class="body-text bold">
          if you could change any part(s) of the design, what what it be?
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <ul>
            User 1: <i>I would get rid of the "Please Wait for Assistance" errors since it kind of defeat the system's purpose.</i>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 2: <i>I guess the scanning process for loose items could be made easier to use. It does take awhile to search through a bunch of items that look similar.</i>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            User 3: <i>A coupon reader could be added.</i>

        Lessons Learned & Afterthoughts
      </div>
      <div class="body-text">
        Conducting behavioral observations, interviewing users, and actively creating personas helped pinpoint users' general thoughts and feelings when using the self checkout station at the supermarket. While many users seem to prefer this checkout option, there are still issues that they face (such as inputting items without barcodes). Much of self checkout designs still need to be improved in the future to accommodate for a larger range of users.
