        <div class="body-text">
          This project was made for CSCI 1300: User Interfaces and User
          Experiences, a class at Brown University taught by
          <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Huang</a>. Our
          goal was to choose a startup and based off of only a short summary of
          the goals of the startup, we had to design an interface and perform
          user testing.
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          Our team of 4 created a prototype tablet app for 
          <a href="https://heptabase.com/" target="_blank">Heptabase</a>, a visual note-taking tool that helps you learn complex topics.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">
          The Problem
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          We attempted to solve the same problem that Heptabase's developers were trying to solve, based only on their description on
          <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/heptabase" target="_blank">YCombinator</a>. This left us with <b>three success criteria</b>:
        </br> </br> 
        1. Our solution must involve putting notes on whiteboards;
         It must allow users to search through their notes to support visual recall; and
         It should ultimately support a user's ability to learn complex topics.
        </br>
         2. It must allow users to search through their notes to support visual recall; and
        </br> 
         3. It should ultimately support a user's ability to learn complex topics.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle iterative">Ideation</div>
   
        <div class="body-text">
          To kickstart our design process, we first drew up several <b>sketches</b> for potential interfaces.
          <img
          class="body-image"
          src="images/iterative design/sketch-iterative.png"
          alt="sketch"
        />
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          In these, we explored a few design alternatives:
          <ul>
            <li>
              We centered our user flows around either a home screen, a files page, or a whiteboard;
            </li>
            <li>
              We considered different primary screen orientations;
            </li>
            <li>
              We varied tool and menu placement, between having toolbars on page margins, buttons that reveal slide-out menus, and icons on notes themselves; and
            </li>
            <li>
              We laid out our file views in different ways (in grids/lists, with/without thumbnails, etc.).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </br>
        We then distilled our sketches into a number of key featuresâ€”ones which we felt would allow our ideal note-taking app to better support learning:
      </br> </br>
      1. <b>Multi-Modal User Input</b>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our app should support both free-hand writing/drawing and typed text, as users absorb content most effectively through different mediums.
        </li>
        <li>
          It should also provide a way to quickly jot down notes with similar levels of flexibility, so that important information isn't missed due to UI inefficiencies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      2. <b>Flexible Organization</b>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The folder system should be as unopinionated as possible, to prevent constraining the user to a certain way of organizing (like OneNote does, with its pages/sections).
        </li>
        <li>
          There should also be ways to side-step bad organization, e.g. search, quick access.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Finally, we refined our sketches into wireframes incorporating the above features:
    </br>
  </br>
  <img
  class="body-image"
  src="images/iterative design/widreframe-iterative.png"
  alt="wireframe"
/>
      </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
          Prototyping & Iteration
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          In order to begin iterating on our design, we first had to have something to show, to collect feedback. Thus, we developed an interactive, high-fidelity prototype in Figma:
        </br>
      </br>
      <img
      class="body-image"
      src="images/iterative design/hifi-iterative.png"
      alt="hifi"
    />
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          Then, having received feedback from fellow UX practitioners, we made a round of revisions addressing the main points brought up in their critiques:
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="body-text">
          1. <b>App Navigation</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              [Feedback] Reviewers didn't expect to be sent to a whiteboard right after logging in.
            </li>
            <li>
              [Improvement] To provide a better mental model of app navigation, we modified our app to instead direct users to the files page, which now acts as a home screen.
            </li>
          </ul>
         2. <b>Feature Learnability</b>
         <ul>
          <li>
            [Feedback] It was unclear what snippets were for and how to use them.
          </li>
          <li>
            [Improvement] To enhance learnability, we added instructional placeholder text to new snippets to help explain their purpose and usage to first-time users and testers. We also added a new user flow to our prototype.
          </li>
        </ul>
        3. <b>File & Folder Creation</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            [Feedback] It wasn't immediately obvious how new files, folders, etc. could be created.
          </li>
          <li>
            [Improvement] We added a "create" section to the files page (accessible also from the files overlay), which allows users to more efficiently create new whiteboards, folders, and/or snippets.
          </li>
        </ul>
        4. <b>Prototype Representativeness</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            [Feedback] Reviewers commented that our prototype's file structure was improbably clean, and wanted to see how we would deal with more "realistic" scenarios: e.g. multiple nested folders.
          </li>
          <li>
            [Improvement] We included more representative files and folders, and added nested folder navigation + scrollability to the prototype. This allowed us to demo a more intensive file structure.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img
        class="body-image"
        src="images/iterative design/changes.png"
        alt="interactive"
      />
      Left: the new home page (1), showing the new "create" section (3), and the breadcrumbs and folder navigation system (4). Right: placeholder text for a new snippet provides insight into how the snippets are meant to be used (2).
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle">
          User Testing
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          As a last step, we also sent our prototype to 
          <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/" target="_blank">UserTesting.com </a>
          to obtain feedback from users outside of the Brown University Community. Their recordings can be found below:

            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          As our app's main functionality centered on multi-modal note-taking and flexible organization, we asked our testers to complete tasks using features relevant to those goals.
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          Specifically, we provided them with the following instructions:
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          1. Find the "Demo Whiteboard", and add a textbox somewhere near its top-left corner.
          </br>
          2. You remember that you took notes on a specific term several weeks ago and want to review them. Use the Search functionality to search for the term "Lorem Ipsum."
        </br>
        3. You have a brilliant idea that you want to write down immediately without creating a new whiteboard. Create and save a new "Snippet" to record your thoughts.
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          Here's a summary of our findings from those user tests:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users found the home page to be intuitive, clean, and easy to navigate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users quickly figured out how to add textboxes and perform searches, as the icons we used for them conveyed their meaning effectively.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creating snippets took the most time, as our users didn't know what a snippet was, nor how to create one.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          These findings aligned with our expectations. We emphasized simplicity in our interfaces, so icons played a heavy role in communicating their functionality. Because snippets are a novel concept, and its icon was poorly chosen, it made sense that users struggled with that task.
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          For our next iteration, we'd like to incorporate an in-app tutorial, in the form of a series of short animatics, to provide first-time users with more clarity. We'd also experiment with different icons for our snippets overlay, possibly changing its placement altogether to improve noticeability and access.
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
          Final Mockup 
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          Our final mockup can be found below:
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          <div class="videowrapper">
            <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2F8aMkwjf3cH4HnFvhJfVHml%2FIterative-Design%3Fscaling%3Dscale-down%26page-id%3D0%253A1%26node-id%3D115%253A2%26starting-point-node-id%3D115%253A2" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <br />
        <br />
      </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          We believe that our app somewhat achieves its goal of being a visual note-taking tool that helps users learn complex topicsâ€”doing so by supporting multi-modal user input and enabling flexible organization. It goes without saying, though, that there is still plenty of room for iteration and improvement!
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">
          Conclusion
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          Through this project, our team came up with a new design for an app based only on a startup's description. We refined sketches and wireframes into interactive prototypes, made improvements based on collected feedback, and conducted user testing.
        </br></br>
        All told, it was good practice! 4 out of 5 dentists agree that iteration is central to good design, after all; though, it's a shame we didn't actually do multiple rounds of it this time.
